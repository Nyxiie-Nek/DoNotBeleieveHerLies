Programs such as outguess allow you to hide
data in .jpg images, and it is password protected.
The passwords are case sensitive, and the standard
here will always be lowercase with no spaces. This
tool will be used ofthen, so keep that in mind. A
correct password will result in a .txt file, an 
incorrect password will not.
You are going to encouter many classical ciphers
along your way, such as caesar shift and vigenere.
